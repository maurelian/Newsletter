# Smart Contract Security Weekly Newsletter

Hi everyone, thanks for making room in your inboxes for this Smart Contract Security Newlsetter. Round 1; here we go:

## Bug Bounties

There are many perpetually ongoing Bug Bounties. But I know you only want the freshest; this is what I could find that launched in the last month: 

* **BrickBlock** ([Launched September 16th, 2018](https://blog.brickblock.io/join-the-brickblock-bug-bounty-program-7b431f2bcc02))
* **0xProject** ([Launched September 5th, 2018](https://0xproject.com/wiki#Bug-Bounty))


## News, articles, resources etc.

##### [The 2018 NSA Codebreaker challenge](https://codebreaker.ltsnet.net/challenge):

... includes a Smart Contract challenge!

> ..., an encrypted copy of the key needed to decrypt the ransomed files has been stored in a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain* and is set to only be unlocked upon receipt of the ransom payment. Your mission is to ultimately (1) find a way to unlock the ransomware without giving in to the attacker’s demands and (2) figure out a way to recover all of the funds already paid by other victims.

I don't understand what that means, but I'm sure they've thought it through. If someone can get me a copy of the actual challenge, that would be awesome.

##### [ERC 1470: Smart Contract Weakness Classification-Registry ](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1469):

> *"The [SWC](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry) is loosely aligned to the terminologies and structure used in the [Common Weakness Enumeration - CWE scheme](https://cwe.mitre.org/)"*. 

This is an informational EIP from my colleague Gerhard.

##### **[Introducing the Powered by Mythril Program](https://media.consensys.net/powered-by-mythril-introducing-the-mythril-partner-program-8acbca470503)**:

Tom maps out the vision for the Mythril platform as a comprehensive secure development platform.

##### [Ethereum security guidance for all](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/10/04/ethereum-security-guidance-for-all):

Our friends at Trail of Bits announced bi-monthly smart contract security open office hours, and outlines other useful resources they have.

##### [EthSecurity's notes from the Security Unconference in Berlin](https://github.com/ethsecurity/berlin-workshop):
Includes slides from presentations, lists of tools, lists of resources and lists of lists. 

##### [Securify is now on GitHub](https://medium.com/chainsecurity/securify-is-now-on-github-d3bec281eafc) :
The analysis engine was previously only available by uploading your code to website; now its [open source](https://github.com/eth-sri/securify)!

##### [SmartDec: Audit Beginners Guide](https://blog.smartdec.net/smartdec-smart-contract-audit-beginners-guide-d04cc7f1c571):

I've not read it carefully, but it seems like a sane audit process walkthrough. 

##### **Bitcoin Core Bug CVE-2018–17144**:

Sorry, it's not about smart contracts, but it's a big deal, and I'm confused by how little discussion I've heard about it. 

The bug (dating back to a PR from 2016), would have allowed the same UTXO to be spent multiple time in a single transaction, enabling an attacker to mint unlimited amounts of bitcoin to themselves. The Core client had checks in place on mempool transactions, but not on block validation, so the attack was only available to miners (and possibly available by renting hash power).

Bitcoin Core Dev, Jimmy Song has a [really thorough technical write up](https://medium.com/@jimmysong/bitcoin-core-bug-cve-2018-17144-an-analysis-f80d9d373362). 

The Bitcoin Cash developer Awemany, who discovered and reported the bug has [his own write up](https://medium.com/@awemany/600-microseconds-b70f87b0b2a6), which is more political and narrative driven, and quite fun to read. It's clear from his story that responsible disclosure is a hard problem in this space. 

Lastly here's a rather [procedural summary on BitcoinCore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2018/09/20/notice/), including a timeline of the response.

That's all for this week. I hope this is interesting and useful to you.

Next week I'll being including relevant job posting. In the meantime we (ConsenSys Diligence) are hiring auditors, a front-end dev, and a product manager.

I'm sure I've missed lots of recent stuff. If you have feedback, or I missed something you think people will want to know about, let me know at maurelian+newsletter@consensys.net.
