Week 3. (Week 2 if I'd been 0-index counting properly)

## Bug Bounties

#### [Aragon Core](https://wiki.aragon.org/dev/bug_bounty/) 

Started on October 17th, with a bounty pool of $250,000, and up to $50,000 for a major bug.

#### [Zac Mitton's eth-heap](https://github.com/zmitton/eth-heap/#bounty) 

A solidity implementation of a [heap data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_%28data_structure%29). I like that he's running a trustless bounty: 

> I took the definitions of what makes a heap a heap, and wrote public functions that release funds iff these properties are broken.

The bounty was [launched 9 days ago, and has 20 ETH in it](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd01c0bd7f22083cfc25a3b3e31d862befb44deeb#code).

#### [DAO Crowdsale V.1](https://web.solidified.io/contract/5bc2619afd407500116a9d19) 

A new bounty on Solidified, it began on October 13th, with payouts up to 5 ETH.

## News and Links

#### [Lane Rettig explains the consensus failure on Ropsten during Constantiple upgrades](https://twitter.com/lrettig/status/1051933396065288192)

> The bug involved the calculation of the gas refund for SSTORE in parity and was a simple integer overflow.

THe medium is the message, and this is a tweetstorm, which for some reason feels really perfect for explaining this kind of event.

#### [Lashing out at a Spank Channel](https://medium.com/coinmonks/lashing-out-at-a-spank-channel-2b42b23f0dc6)

Summary of the SpankChain payment channel hack, including a sample attack contract.

#### [The Anatomy of a Block Stuffing Attack](https://osolmaz.com/2018/10/18/anatomy-block-stuffing/)

Solid description of the generic class of attack in which you prevent other parties from participating by filling blocks with spam. It includes a chain data driven breakdown of the FOMO3D attack; which was finally ended by just this kind of attack. Apparently someone else had a bot that tried unuccessfully to beat out the eventual winner in the final few blocks. 

This needs an entry in our Best Practices if anyone wants to [submit a PR](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/issues/171). 


#### [Slither â€“ a Solidity static analysis framework](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/10/19/slither-a-solidity-static-analysis-framework/)

An outline of Slither's features, including CI capabilities, summary printers and inheritance graphs. 


#### New content in the ConsenSys Smart Contract Best Practices

We've added some new sections, including guidance on ['Using events in Solidity'](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#use-events-to-monitor-contract-activity), ['Type safety when passing addresses as arguments'](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#use-interface-type-instead-of-the-address-for-type-safety), and ['The safe use of modifiers in solidity'](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#use-modifiers-only-for-assertions). 

We also [updated the timestamp variation range from 30 to 15 seconds](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#the-15-second-rule), because that's what Geth and Parity actually implement. Incidentally, I [created an EIP](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/define-a-maximum-block-timestamp-drift/1556) to formalize this, though I don't imagine it's a high priority among the recent Constantinople issues.

We're always happy to get feedback on anything in the best practices. Just open an issue. 

#### [Ethernaut has been adding new challenges](https://ethernaut.zeppelin.solutions/)

Thanks to @gakonst for the tip off.
