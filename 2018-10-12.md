OK, week 2! 

## Bug Bounties

No new ones this week, but I've start keeping a list of ongoing ones [here](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/bug_bounty_list/).  

Also, I heard spankchain might have a bug bounty program in the works...

## News

#### [The SpankChain hack](https://medium.com/spankchain/we-got-spanked-what-we-know-so-far-d5ed3a0f38fe)

**Summary:**

165 ETH were stolen from SpankChain's "Bi-directional" payment channel contract. The hacker gave it back and SpankChain gave them a reward! Good show.

The exploit was a case of the old "Reentry from Malicious token". 

Moral of the story: **if a user can provide your contract with an address, be really careful about making calls to it**.

I haven't seen a thorough disection, but I took a quick look at it, then put the [contract code into a gist](https://gist.github.com/maurelian/ab9b4e0c089870a2bc36b47ca5ae3a56) and added some comments of the format `// Hack Note:`, to point you in the right direction. 

If someone is ambitious enough to write up a better summary or walkthrough, LMK and I'll share it next week. 

#### [Etherscan has a new 'heist' tag](https://etherscan.io/accounts?l=Heist)

Listing contracts involved in thievery.

#### [Stanford Blockchain Conference Call for Papers](https://cyber.stanford.edu/sbc19)

Deadline is October 16th.

#### [Discovering Signature Verification Bugs in Ethereum Smart Contracts](https://medium.com/@gerhard.wagner/discovering-signature-verification-bugs-in-ethereum-smart-contracts-424a494c6585)

Gerhard and his mullet have gone independent for this article, and highlights a couple signature verification issues you might run into. A really terrible tldr of those is: 

1. If you don't want replays, you probably need to put something in storage.
2. If you do funky call forwarding stuff, be careful about treating `msg.sender` as a signature.

#### [Marking Safer Wallet Contracts with Panvala](https://medium.com/@Panvala/marking-safer-wallet-contracts-with-panvala-2e2fa15e3e03)

A demo session will be run to model the Panvala council, and discuss the strengths of various multisig implementations.

#### The Trail of Bits section

* They're running a [training session after DevCon](https://twitter.com/japesinator/status/1050456225408790528)
* They published some content from a [workshop on Echidna and Slither]((https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/tree/master/workshops/Automated%20Smart%20Contracts%20Audit%20-%20TruffleCon%202018)) they gave recently at Truffle Con. 

#### [teEther: Gnawing at Ethereum to Automatically Exploit Smart Contracts](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-krupp.pdf)

Yet-another automatic exploit paper... but there's some buzz around it. My cursory reading suggests they may have found as-of-yet unexploited vulnerabilities in contracts on the main Ethereum network. So that would be pretty impressive!

#### [Solidity CTF — Part 4: Read the Fine Print](https://medium.com/authio/solidity-ctf-part-4-read-the-fine-print-5ad259a5f5bb)

These guys' CTFs are quite instructive. 

#### [Some OG laptop miner put 310 BTC in a jpeg](https://bitcoinchallenge.codes/)

Here's a walkthrough of finding some of the smaller prizes in it.

How does so much stuff happen just in security? How does Evan possibly cover ALL of ethereum? 

I'm sure I've missed lots of recent stuff. If you have feedback, or I missed something you think people will want to know about, let me know at maurelian+newsletter@consensys.net.
